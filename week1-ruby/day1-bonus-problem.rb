# Bonus problem: If youâ€™re feeling the need for a little more,
# write a pro- gram that picks a random number. Let a player 
# guess the number, telling the player whether the guess is too 
# low or too high. (Hint: rand(10) will generate a random number 
# from 0 to 9, and gets will read a string from the keyboard 
# that you can translate to an integer.)

number = rand(10)
guess = -1

until guess == number
        puts "Guess the number (0-9)"
        guess = (gets).to_i
end

puts "Congrats! #{guess} was the secret number!"
